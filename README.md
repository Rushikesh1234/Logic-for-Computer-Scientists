# Logic-for-Computer-Scientists

<br>

Logic has been an essential tool to represent and reason with a variety of tasks from the foundation of computing to the computational understanding of intelligence. This course will cover the part of the logic that is widely used in computer science: propositional logic and predicate logic. It also aims to offer training opportunities for rigorous reasoning (e.g., definition and proof techniques).
